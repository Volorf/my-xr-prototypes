# XR Prototypes

A collection of my XR prototypes as apk files. All apk files are in the `Builds` folder.

## How to install an apk
The simplest way to do it is to intall the apps via [Meta Quest Developer Hub](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-developer-hub-win/).

### 1. Add an app to MQDH
Press the `Add Build` button and select an app on your disk.

## #154 Numeric Keyboard with Eye Tracking

<img src="Images/154_numeric_keyboard_with_eye_tracking.gif" width="800px">

Prototyped a numeric keypad with eye-tracking and hand-tracking inputs similar to what we saw on Apple's Vision Pro demo. I used Oculus Integration and ran it on Quest Pro (it's the only Quest that supports eye-tracking).

It feels very natural and familiar. We already use the same principles for regular keyboard-based, non-blind typing. First, you visually allocate a target, and then your hand confirms an intended action. But the eye-tracking version is less laborious since this hand confirmation is remote, and you don't need to "physically" interact with the keyboard.
