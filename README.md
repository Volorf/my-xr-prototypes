# XR Prototypes

A collection of my XR prototypes as apk files. All apk files are in the `Builds` folder.

## How to install an apk
The simplest way to do it is to intall the apps via [Meta Quest Developer Hub](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-developer-hub-win/).

### 1. Add an app to MQDH
Press the `Add Build` button and select an app on your disk.
